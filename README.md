- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jerry I'm just starting my adventure with github and so far I haven't had the need to publish my work.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Electronics, robotics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning speaks Vietnamese
- ðŸ“« How to reach me jzaperty@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm sorry if I offend anyone, but I'm still from that era in which there were two genders and I use the one I was born with, so I'm a man. so you can talk to me as long as you want, don't insult me, I will talk to you
- âš¡ Fun fact: In the 1990s, in order to play games, I had to copy the code from the "MÅ‚ody Technik" newspaper in the Basic programming language. The computers I had at my disposal at that time were Commodore 64 and Aple2e. This is how my adventure with programming began
